notes written after submission to ECAL

me:

haha yeah. so i think two things can happen, possibly a third. some dude has a simple spiking model that i put off looking at, but i might take another look. it would be cool to play with spiking neurons. maybe not necessary. im looking at implementing a couple things. i think  the activation of A and B need to be far closer in magnitude... so, im not sure how weights should be organized, or decay, or something, but i think part of the instability lies in the fact that too many things can influence the neuron's activation, and theres no way for a neuron B to compare itself to its' presynaptic neurons and say, we' both activated more, and we're both activated approx. the same amount, so, strengthen connection'. there's also no firing frequency, which means if we stick with non-spiking, they need to match up in activation more closely. then we can use that for learning as well. i also think that setting up location based shit might be interesting, but as it stands now, anything that doesn't already have a connection, can't just form one, so that's cool, but limiting. third thing is figuring out how to simplify the network while not losing functionality (how could our fake visual system interpolate like real ones do?). and finally, some sort of additional neuromodulator that influences learning rate. mutability alone seems like too large a net; lacks nuance. these notes are as much for me as they are for you. interested in your thoughts.

-> 'neutral' sensory stimuli shouldn't be tied to any emotions, at first.
-> perhaps you can link functionality in neurons that are totally unrelated, so that if stimulus A causes C to activate, there's no risk of screwing up any other subsystem, even though B also synapses onto A -- but would only activate under different circumstances'
