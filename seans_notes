The summation in chemical synapse:
    - reversal_potential - v_current
    -- Doesn't this always turn out negative regardless, therefore always
       reducing the neurons voltage no matter what?

voltages_vec vs updated_voltages:
    - Obviously we update the voltage value in updated_voltages
    - Do we also update the value in voltages_vec or do we have all neurons run
      off the input voltage values instead of updated values?
    -- Doesn't look like it matters, didn't change the values
