/* we need another blade:
 
 =========> 'active state', cut down on this.
 -----------> 'sleeping state', or 'reflective state', maybe go back and do something?
 
 
 
 
 so, just as the connectome is a square matrix, and each entry is a weight,
 in this blade, each entry will be a crossCorrelation
 
 maybe -- pass in two, three, etc.. historic voltage arrays, and compute the xcorr in the kernel,
 and then alter the weight based upon that:
    -> if postiviely correlated at 0 offset (signals are on top of eachother):
        -> if positive change in correlation (so, more positive):
            -> increase strength of excititory synapse
        -> if negative change in correlation (so, less positive):
            -> decrease strength of excitatory synapse
    -> if inversely correlated at 0 offset (signals are on top of eachother)::
        -> if positive change in correlation (so, more negative):
            -> increase strength of inhibitory synapse
        -> if negative change in correlation (so, less negative):
            -> decrease strength of inhibitory synapse
    -> if postiviely correlated at offset > 0, where presynaptic neuron's signal is offset:
        -> if positive change in correlation (so, more positive):
            -> increase strength of excititory synapse
        -> if negative change in correlation (so, less positive):
            -> decrease strength of excitatory synapse
    -> if inversely correlated at offset > 0, where presynaptic neuron's signal is offset:
        -> if positive change in correlation (so, more negative):
            -> increase strength of inhibitory synapse
        -> if negative change in correlation (so, less negative):
            -> decrease strength of inhibitory synapse
 
 
    => note: 'change' refers to xcorr value from previous time-step (iteration)
 
    So, how do gap junctions factor into this? 
        -> 
            * if neuron A, at time n (A[n]) has an activation, x, and
            * if neuron B, at time n (B[n]) has an activation, y, and
            * if A[n+1] has an activation x+dX, then:
                * if B[n+1] has an activation y+dY
                => we have a correlation
                * if B[n+1] has an activation,  y, and if B[n+2] has an activation y+dY
                => we have a causal relationship
