\section{Thoughts}



\textbf{Ortus basic premise:} entire system works similarly to the CO2 and O2 regulation mechanism. Aim is to keep a balance. E.g., if IFEAR goes up, this should inherently be bad. Could be that the reason for this is that it is tied to a very basic system, like breathing. So, if system is wired such that as INO2 increases, IFEAR increases, and an increase in INO2 causes an intake of O2, which decreases INO2, the system \textit{inherently} wants to minimize INO2 and IFEAR. Everything should build off of and/or expand this basic idea/structure.

Take C. elegans, for example. It only has 302 neurons, and is a relatively simple organisim, with is connectome nearly entirely known. Despite its relative simplicity, it is capable of avoiding toxins (cite toxin avoidance), and withdrawing from a touch to the head. Both of these actions show a tendency to minimize certain conditions. In the context of an organism as simple as C. elegans, it becomes clear that this tendency arises from a circuit configuration that causes certain ``pre-wired'' responses to be preside over others. \textbf{This another premise of Ortus:} The idea of ``emotions'', as we know them, are simply the rise and fall in activation of different groups of neurons, tied to very fundamental behaviors. The concepts of ``good'' and ``bad'' sensations or emotions only carry meaning to us because of their associations to circuits that are either desirable or undesirable from a longevity perspective.


\begin{outline}
\point perhaps use a ``chemical'' to signal that a synapse may be be created
\point may also need to factor location in\ldots that would be a pain, because each synapse would need a 3D coordinate.
\point classical conditioning -- two stimuli paired, instrumental conditioning -- stimulus -> response -> reward
\point as things get repeated, the pathway between input and output shortens (creates a ``reflexive reaction'', though not the same as a real reflex, like a knee jerk)
  \subpoint \textbf{Ortus premise:} Essentially, complex behaviors are more nuanced reflexes. A reflex goes from a sensory neuron to the spinal cord where interneurons redirect the signal to a motorneuron. Complex behaviors originate from some combination of existing neural activity and sensory input, which combine and, after being passed through a number of different interneurons, end up as signals to motor neurons, or loop back around to continue the ``thought'' process.
\point Should have a loop that re--energizes (in a decaying way) neural pathways/circuits that were recently used. In this way, perhaps we can implement instrumental learning, and time--based/sequence--based knowledge.
\point rodent and human brain have same basic structure, it seems. things tend to be organized fairly similarly, relative to each other. \ref{MNCF:wiredforbehaviors}
\point \ref{MNCF:wiredforbehaviors} are discussing rodent experiments that cause lesions to regions of the brain, so ortus should be able to function by using single neurons to represent groups of neurons, while there isn't a requirement for greater behavioral nuance.
\point What if the inherent connections we have are the only ones that just 'grow', and the only way to grow new synapses from experiences/life is something similar to the ``triangle inequality''
    \subpoint If A fires, and B fires, and C fires, and A has a CS with B, and B has a CS with C, then we create a synapse between A and C.
    \subpoint For GJs, if A fires, and D fires, and at the same time, B fires and C fires, and A has a CS with D, and B has a CS with C, then we can create a GJ between C and D.
\point might make sense to have different ``genes'' responsible for excitatory and inhibitory synapses
\point problem with worm was we would need to get too specific, and that doesn't necessarily help with generalized AI. For that goal, it makes sense to look at specific things, but then to figure out how to map that to a more generalized approach---e.g., map the concept of ``genes'' to something pluggable/switchable that can help shape a connectome.
    \subpoint essentially, virtual DNA.
        \subsubpoint InstructionUnits $\rightarrow$ CIU (ConnectomeInstructionUnit)
  \point \textbf{Perhaps theres a chemical marker for simultaenous actions that tells the body to associate two or more sets of stimuli}
  \point visual encoding (assume 16 pixels):
    \subpoint group of 4 pixels in center, red, needs to be associated with a ``touch'', so some neuron gets the input from those 4 pixels, and passes that signal along to another neuron, which also gets the touch. this neuron passes that signal along.
    \subpoint other 4 pixels, same operation, different neuronal chain.
    \subpoint now, it sees both at once, so the second layer of neurons both go into a different 3rd layer (separate from the other 2 3rd layer ones that had other associations), and tie that together with some other sensory input.
    \subpoint the more you do this, the more intertwined your visual system becomes.
\point May need to work with space/location, but in a relative sense. A 3D coordinate may not be necessary or make sense, but perhaps each cell needs to know how close it is to other cells?
    \subpoint might be able to use a proximity coefficient for any two neurons\ldots problem here is we would have to either have different ones for different synapses, or assume it's okay to assign neuron to neuron PCs as opposed to synapse to synapse ones.
    \subpoint adjacent body parts, areas on skin, are ``represented'' by similarly adjacent neurons
\point locally--correlated, patterned firing 
\point grow synapses with nearby neurons, maybe try reaching out probabalistically or something?
\point The fact that new axonal branch tips emerge near existing synapses means that behavior gets reinforced and things ortus repeats will become more and more ingrained\ldots this seems to have implications for forming new memories, and short term memories.
\end{outline}

A neuron is kind of like a person\ldots You go out and meet 5 people. 3 of them you get along with, and 2 you don't. You end up meeting the friends of those 3 people, and maybe like a few of them, and then your network will grow/strengthen in much the same way as a neuron's axon does.

\textbf{Example of CIU idea from above}
Not going to model cell division, too low level. But, it's clear we need a set of sensory inputs, a set of motor outputs, a set of ``emotions'' (including things like pain, etc in that set), and an initial set of innate behaviors. For example:

\textbf{Format: if ``A'' then ``B'' which is Rule \#X}
\begin{outline}
\point -O2 $\rightarrow$ +MINHALE, -MEXHALE $\Rightarrow$ R1
\point +CO2 $\rightarrow$ +MEXHALE, -MINHALE $\Rightarrow$ R2

Video: From DNA to protein - 3D
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA}

\begin{outline}
  \nopoint My understanding is:
  \point DNA is made up of nucleotides
  \point Sections of DNA encode various genes
    \subpoint Intergenic DNA (DNA between genes) seems to play a part in determining which genes are turned on/off, among other things. (this is part of the 98\% of DNA not coding for genes)
        \subsubpoint There is also DNA that sits in the middle of genes at times
            \supersubpoint Exons $\rightarrow$ coding sequences, introns $\rightarrow$ intervening sequences
  \point Enzymes unzip the DNA, and one side is transcribed to generate RNA---a single strand of nucleotides
    \subpoint This happens for genes that are ``turned on'' 
    \subpoint Each cell only ``turns on'' the genes it needs to do its job; this is due to proteins on the RNA polymerase
  \point Codons are groups of 3 nucleotides, from the RNA strand, that code for amino acids
    \subpoint There are ``start'' and ``end'' codons that mark the start and end of each gene
  \point Amino acids are protein building blocks
  \point The ribosomes then convert the codons from the RNA strand to proteins
    \subpoint Prior to this, parts of the RNA are cut out during RNA splicing
        \subsubpoint Exons are stitched together, using introns to dictate things like ``alternative splicing''
    \subpoint genes are instructions for making certain proteins
  \point The proteins ``made'' by some genes can act as switches
    \subpoint If something goes wrong, a leg could grow instead of an antennae, for example.
        \subsubpoint \textbf{This suggests that as replication happens, slight changes in the expressed genes are (more or less) deterministically carried out to ensure that things like arms, legs, vertebrae, etc. grow exactly as they should}
  \point Some of these proteins are receptors for neurons 
    \subpoint Some of these receptors are ligand--gated ion channels, that open to allow ions into or out of the neuron/cell.
        \subsubpoint AKA ion--channel--linked receptors
        \subsubpoint ligands are the neurotransmitters

\section{Parts of the Brain}

\begin{outline}
    \point cerebral cortex (cerebrum)
        \subpoint frontal lobe (top front) -- reasoning, planning, parts of speech, movement, emotions, problem solving
        \subpoint parietal lobe (top middle)-- movement,  orientation, recognition, perception of stimuli
        \subpoint occipital lobe -- visual processing
        \subpoint temporal lobe -- perception and recognition of auditory stimuli, memory, and speech
    \point cerebellum (little brain)
        \subpoint associated with regulation and coordination of movement, posture, and balance
        \subpoint evolutionarily really old; reptiles have this as more or less their full brain
    \point limbic system (emotional brain) -- buried within cerebrum, like cerebellum, fairly old
      \subpoint Thalamus - relays sensory impulses from receptors in various parts of the body to the cerebral cortex. Experts think of it as a gate. 98\% of sensory input is relayed by it (not olfaction? -- maybe olfaction is a more primitive sense that routes to cerebellum, and is similar to chemosensors in c. elegans?).
      \subpoint Hypothalamus  -- controls release of 8 major hormones, involved in temperature regulation, control of food and water intake,  sexual behavior,  daily cycles in physiological state and behavior, and mediation of emotional responses. 
      \subpoint Amygdala -- integrative center for emotions, emotional behavior, and motivation.  where memory and emotions are ``combined''. combines many different sensory inputs.
        \subsubpoint Amygdalofugal Pathway (link whereby motivation and drives can influence responses, and where responses are learned, rewards and punishments), stria terminalis (similar to fornix) -- both important, come back to this.
      \subpoint Hippocampus -- associated primarily with memory. looks like a seahorse. 
    \point Brain Stem -- underneath limbic system, responsible for basic vital life functions such as breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure.
        \subpoint Midbrain -- (tectum, the 'roof', and tegmentum, in front of the tectum). Tectum responsible for visual reflexes. Tegmentum coordinates sensorimotor  information. 
        \subpoint Pons -- connects the spinal cord to higher brain levels, and transfers info from cerebrum to cerebellum, some of which are part of the reticular formation, which  regulates alertness, sleep, and wakefulness.
        \subpoint Medulla -- transmits signals between the spinal cord and higher parts of the brain, controls autonomic functions like heartbeat and respiration. Also holds part of reticular formation.
    \point grey matter: pinkish--grey, contains cell bodies, dendrites, and axon terminals -- so, this is where the synapses actually are. On outside of brain, but inside of spinal cord.
    \point white matter: axons, which are connecting the different parts of grey matter to each other. On inside of brain, but outside of spinal cord.
\end{outline}


So, basically, input goes into thalamus, and is then relayed, in this way, associations can be built. Thalamus has three groups of cells:
\begin{outline}
\point Sensory relay nuclei -- These include the ventral posterior nucleus and lateral and medial geniculate body. Relay primary sensations by passing specific sensory information to the corresponding cortical area. 
\point Association nuclei -- receive input from specific areas of the cortex, which is projected back to the cortex to ``somewhat'' generalized association areas, where they regulate activity.
\point non--specific nuclei (intralaminar and midline thalamic), which receive input from cerebral cortex and project information diffusely through it. Most of these interconnect brain activity between different areas of the brain and play a role in general functions such as alerting.

\section{Rules for shaping neural connections in the developing brain \cite{Kutsarova2016}}

\textbf{note: get flow chart image, figure 2, on page 12}

Review article, proposes a detailed set of cellular rules that govern activity-dependent circuit refinement. Synthesizes what has been learned in the extensive experimental lit. on the dev. of the visual system. (strong emphasis on data obtained from live imaging of the retinotectal projection in fish and frogs). Unlike mammals, these animals rely extensively on vision for survival from very early dev. stages, and use this same visual info to direct circuit refinement.

Note: Presumably this translates to other parts of the brain, mammal or not??

\begin{outline}
  \point In the contralateral optic tectum, axonal temrinals are organized such that they reconstitute a topographic map of the retina
    \point Binocular projections segregate into alternating eye--specific bands in th rostral colliculus (in mammals)
    \point the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN) in the thalamus is thought to erve as the fundamental relay station through which visual information is passed to higher order cortical visual centers where increasingly complex features are extracted from visual scenes
    \point the most prominent activity--dependent stages of brain circuit refinement do not necessarily take place at the same time in development (organization for different parts matures at different times), so the rules that control retinotectal refinement may be fundamentally different, or manifest themselves differently, during later refinement events.
\end{outline}

\textbf{Rules for Retinotectal Structural Plasticity}

\begin{outline}
 \point Molecular guidance cues provide information for coarse axonal targeting 
    \subpoint Retinal Ganglion Cell (RGC) axons will regrow to roughly the same (correct) locations after having been sectioned
    \subpoint Gradients of expressions of ligands cause axon attraction and repulsion, and seems to guide the path axons take
        \subsubpoint Known as Sperry's ``Chomaffinity Hypothesis''
 \point Inputs compete for available synaptic target space
    \subpoint It seems that relative levels of ligand expression controls the organization of a topographically ordered map.
    \subpoint At the single axon level, a transplanted RGC was allowed to innervate the optic tectum of a lakritz mutant fish, incapable of generating its own RGCs. The single axon was free to innervate its target in the complete absence of competition from other retinal afferents. The axon managed to target its topographically appropriate termination zone, but formed abnormally large terminal arbors. (note: they switched from singlar to pural midway though)
        \subsubpoint this suggests that retinal axons do have at least a crudely defined inherent preferred termination zone within the target, presumably due to chemoaffinity cues, but that in the absence of competition for space, arbors can enlarge their coerage area (to an extent).
    \subpoint Seems to be more--or--less independent of neural activity 
        \subsubpoint reducing ability for some RGCs to fire decreases the size of arbors from those cells relative to those not restricted, however blocking all activity across the network restored normal arbor size to all cells.
            \supersubpoint So, axon arbor size---important for the precision of connectivity--is regulated by activity--dependent competitive interactions
 \point Axonal and dendritic arbors are highly dynaimc, even after seemingly mature morphology is attained
    \subpoint Live imaging of axonal and dendritic remodeling in intact, transparent zebrafish and Xenopus (frog) embryos has shown that axons are perpetually extending and retracting extensive interstitial branch tips to prob the target area
    \subpoint In zebrafish, the process by which an axon arrives at and elaborates extensive branch tips within its final terminaltion zone is not directed growth, but rather what appears to be be a process of random branch extension in which the overall progression of branch elongation and stabilization favors the future termination zone
    \subpoint Similar in Xenopus, but individual arbors occupy a relatively larger proportion of the total tectal neuropil from earlier stages, creating a situation in which the topographic map increases in precision with age (by both restricting axonal branches to appropriate locations, and constant growth of the total retinorecipient field with age)
    \subpoint As the tectum expands by adding cells, RGC arbors adjust and improve their relative retinotopic order by gradually shifting their positions
    \subpoint even in relativley mature tadpoles, in which RGC axons have attained their mature size and complexity, time lapse imaging still reveals ongoing remodeling and exploratory probing at branch tips (at considerably slower rates)


 \point Patterened neuronal activity provides instructive cues that help refine inputs:

  \subpoint dark--rearing -- seems not to impact refinement of visual system, but dark rearing also doesn't necessarily deprive the visual system of all activity
    \subpoint in contrast to dark--rearing, using TTX to block action potential firing during optic nerge regeneration (in adult goldfish) prevented the refinement of multiunit receptive field sizes, and resulted in the degradation of precision in the anatomical projection
      \subsubpoint axonal arbors were significantly enlarged
        \supersubpoint in Xenopus tadpoles, blocking retinal APs led to a rapid increase in axonal branch dynamics measured as number of branches added and lost per 2 h.
    \subpoint Locally--correlated, patterned firing in the retina, whether mediated by visual stimuli or spontaneous retinal waves, carries information about the relative locations of RGCs with respect to one another that the system can use to instruct map refinement.
      \subsubpoint The notion of correlated firing between pre and post synaptic cells modifying synaptic strength in response to coo-activation (Hebb synapse) comes from the observation of basal occlusion by $Mg^{2+}$ of the ion channel of NMDA receptors; which is the principal glutamate receptor type found at newly formed synapses
        \supersubpoint only when the dual requirements of glutamate binding and simulataneous postsynaptic depolariziation to relieve the $Mg^{2+}$ block of the pore are satisfied can the NMDAR flux current. This property of the NMDAR means that it can function as a molecular detector of correlated activity.
        \supersubpoint \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor}
      \subsubpoint blocking NMDARs with APV (which blocks the glutamate binding site) prevents refinement of retinotectal maps, meaning that NMDARs presumably act as correlation detectors.
    \subpoint Stroboscopic rearing---producing an atypically high degree of correlation in the firing activity of RGCs---in goldfish, caused retinotectal projections to substantitally overlap, and fail to refine throught development.
        \subsubpoint these animals showed poor topographic refinement, with atypically large response fields.
            \supersubpoint regenerating projections exhibit a similar failure to refine under conditions of stroboscopic illumination
        \subsubpoint individual RGCs showed long axonal arbors that were diffusely branched (rather than having formed dense clusters of branches at the temrination zone)
        \subsubpoint Though it seems that mice, which normally have binocular innervation of the SC, that had experienced optogenetic simultaneous co--activation of the two eye during the period of retinotectal axon ingrowth prio to eye--opening, ipsilateral eye afferent were no longer restricted to deeper tectal layers but instead appeared able to stabilize inputs within the more superficial layers where contralateral inputs normally terminate exclusively.
        \supersubpoint (Note: my understanding of this, is that the stimulation impacted the growth of the axons such that they tried to account for the activation, suggesting that the correlated stimulation of both eyes caused the axons to grow as if they were coming from the same eye---in a sense) \textbf{look into this\ldots}

    \subpoint Synchronous firing stabilizes synapses and prolongs branch lifetimes while actively suppressing branch dynamics via N--methyl D--aspartate receptor (NMDAR)--dependent retrograde signaling

        \subsubpoint In order for Hebbian structural plasticity to be relevant to map refinement, postsynaptic signaling must be able to drive changes in the presynaptic axons through the production of one or more retrograde signals that can act back on the presynaptic terminal
        \subsubpoint normal visual experience during the period of developmental refinement can activate postsynaptic NMDARs, and blocking NMDARs (with APV) results in a rapid upregulation of presynaptic RGC axon branch dynamics (greater number of new branch tips added and retracted) at the axon terminal.
        \subsubpoint further, virually infecting postsynaptic tectal neurons, but not presynaptic RGCs with tCaMKII (a constitutively active truncated form of CaMKII, which lacks the autoinhibitory regulatory domaon, but mimics the activation of CaMKII that takes place in LTP induction), showed the expected enhancement in synaptic AMPAR currents as NMDAR--only ``silent synapses'' matures en masse to become AMPAR-containing functional synapses
            \supersubpoint also found that RGC axon arbors grew less and had a much lower branch tip density than control cells, suggesting the existence of a retrograde signal downstream of CaMKII activation that stabilizes existing branches and suppresses branch elaboration as it drives synaptic maturation

    \subpoint Asynchronous activity weakens synapses (LTD)  and actively promotes axonal branch dynamics, including addition and elongation, as well as branch elimination (Stentian mechanisms)
        \subsubpoint most retinotectal projection in Xenopus tadpoles is almost purely contralateral, occasionally one or two RGC axons end up projecting to the ipsilateral optictectum (accidentally). These end up forming synaptic contacts within the ipsilateral tectum, presumably responding to the same molecular cues that guide the contralateral RGC axons to form a crude map.
        \subsubpoint can test Hebbian ``fire together, wire together'' on these animals  because the only way the lone ipsilateral RGC will fire tectal neurons is to make it fire at the same time as the contralateral inputs (so, flash light at one eye vs both eyes).
        \subsubpoint electrophysiological recordings showed that when both eyes were stimulated together, the ipsilateral input maintained or even slightly increased its synpatic strength relavite to the contralateral inputs, but when the two eyes were stimulated 1 second apart, the ipsilateral eye input (which by itself is usually not strong enough to drive the postsynaptic neurons to fire action potentials), very rapidly declines in synaptic strength and in many cases entirely loses its ability to evoke an AMPAR--mediated postsynaptic current.
        \subsubpoint Asynchronous stimulation of the two eyes resulted in a rapid (within 30 min) and dramatic uprgulation of new branch additions, and a significant increase in branch tip elognation compared with axon dynamics during a preceeding period of darkness. Elimination of branch tips was also enhanced, indicating that rather than prouducing a larger arbour, aysynchronous stimulation makes the axon more dynamic and exploratory (similar to the effects of the NMDAR blockade).
          \supersubpoint its unlikely that the lone ipsilateral axon would by itself be able to drive sufficient depolarlization of the postsynaptic tectal cell to permit $Ca^{2+}$ flux through NMDARs, and addition of MK801 to block NMDARs did not prevent the increased rate of branch additions in response to asynchronous stimulation. It is therefore possible that the source of the branch promoting signal may not be postsynaptic in origin, but could, for example be released by surrounding glial cells, or come directly from nearby axon terminals.
        \subsubpoint in contrast, synchronous stimulation of the two eyes resulted in a rapid decrease in the rate of branch additions to levels seen in darkness. This decrease in branch dynamic behavior was completely prevented in the presence of MK801, or if tetanus toxin was expressed in the ipsilateral axon to render it incapable of releasing neurotransmitter.
            \supersubpoint this indicates that the activation of postsynaptic NMDARs likley leads to the release of a retrograde branch suppressing factor. In addition, branches that did form during synchronous stimulation had longer lifetimes on average than those that emerged during periods of asynchronous stimulation, indicating that they were more stable overall.
        \subsubpoint In the normal process of activity--dependent developmental refinement, a typical axon might be expected to experience a more modest range of local correlation and asynchrony that would lead to a slight upregulation of exploratory branching and synapse dissasembly on those branches that extend away from the proper termination zone (promoting them to keep growing until they land in more welcoming territory), and a stabilization and synaptic strengthening on those branches that extend into the appropriate part of the map where inputs with similar activity patterns converge (promoting consolidation and further synaptogenesis at this site). See figure 1 in ppaper if interested\ldots
    
 \point In the absence of sensory input, correlated spontaneous firing provides surrogate patterned activity
    \subpoint ``retinal waves'' are patterns of spontaneous activity that exhibit a high degree of local correlation in firing, observed in the fetal retinal
    \subpoint RGCs located in close proximity overlap their bursting activity in time, whereas RGCs that reside further away from each other are less likley to be co-active. This spaciotemporal pattern of RGC activity results from a local initiation of depolarization, which propagates to adjacent neurons, spreading over long distances across the retina.
  
 \point New axonal branch tips emerge near existing synapses
    \subpoint wherever a synapse strengthens (or weakens) through activity--dependent plasticity, it will be available (or not) to nucleate new branches from which new synapses can form.
        \subsubpoint This consitutes a positive feedback loop that will lead to the targeted alaboration of axonal arbor at the site where that axon has formed effective, strong synaptic contacts, and the scaling back of branch inititation at inappropriate sites where synapses may form transiently but are subseqently eliminated.

 \point Stronger synapses help stabilize the axons and dendrites on which they form (Synaptotropism)
    \subpoint Synaptic sites are fairly labile (easily changed). The dendritic tree elaborates through a process of dynamic filopodial extensions followed rapidly by synapse formation.
    \subpoint As synapses form, those synapse--bearing branches become consolidated, and further branch extension then proceeds by building upon those more stable sites.
        \subsubpoint blocking neurexin/neuroligin signaling or AMPAR trafficking (in Xenopus) tectal neurons prevents synaptogenesis or synapse maturation (respectively)---resulting in a failure to elaborate normal complex dendritic arbors.
    \subpoint in zebrafish and Xenopus tadpoles, within minutes of RGC axonal branch extension, synaptophysin-GFP puncta could be oberved accumulating int he wake of the advancing growth cone. Some synaptic puncta were later lost, while other became more mature over time. When these branches later attempted to retract, the presence of a mature synaptic site conferred structural stability, preventing the branch from withdrawing beyond that site.

 \point Homeostatic mechanisms help maintain the overall level of functional synaptic input to the target
    \subpoint Both the Hebbian and Stentian mechanisms in the context of changes in synaptic efficacy are inherently unstable
        \subsubpoint for Hebbian, the positive feedback loop would become unsustainable, and for Stent's extension, each time the synapse weakened, it would become less and less likely that it would strengthen again (because it would be less likley that they pre and post cells would be correlated)
    \subpoint The brain overcomes this inherent instability by enforcing a range of synaptic transmission within which bidirectional changes in synaptic efficacy can occur---known as ``homeostatic plasticity''
    \subsubpoint \textbf{look into this.}

(Note: this is a book comprised of research articles, title of relevant articles as subsections)


\subsection{Introduction to mechanisms of neural circuit formation}
Topics in book:
\begin{outline}
\point cell adhesion molecules (and downstream roles in cell identity, recognition, and synaptic specificity)
\point axon guidance, formation of terminals, and dendritic arborization
\point formation of synaptic structures themselves (remains subject to remodeling and plasticity throughout development and even in adult animals)
\end{outline}

\subsection{Wired for Behaviors: from development to function of innate limbic system circuitry, 2012}
\label{MNCF:wiredforbehaviors}

\begin{outline}
  \point ``Limbic system links external cues possessing emotional, social, or motivational relevance to a specified set of contextual and species--specific appropriate behavioral outputs''
  \point Some enhanced through experiential learning and reinforcement, but others are innate
    \subpoint courtship, maternal care, defense, establishment of social hierarchy $\rightarrow$ all ensure survival of individual or offspring, and thus propagation of species
    \subpoint regulated and influenced by sensory stimuli
  \point ``Emotional salience, produced in the amygdala, is generally thought of as a prime driving force behind innate human behaviors, typically social in nature''
  \point This review focuses on the rodent, and because sensory inputs to rodents are primarily smell, audio, and touch, (with minimal visual inputs), the review focuses on chemosensation and how it relates to mating, maternal care, etc.
  \point innate rodent behaviors, e.g.: female prefers male urine odors to female, or no odors (naive); mouse that has never encountered a predator will display signs of fear in response to predator odors.
  \subpoint These chemicals are detected in the nose, processed by the Main and Accessory Olfactory Bulbs (MOB, AOB), projections from the AOB and MOB (directly or indirectly) synapse onto a number of higher order structures (olfactory cortex, amygdala), and the amygdala sent projections to the hypothalamus for further integration and coordination with the brain stem to initiate ``fight or flight'' responses.
      \subsubpoint although they will focus their attention on this circuit, they state that: ``we would like to emphasize that these brain hubs and their many feedback loops are not the sole components of a highly complex neural network important for the regulation of sociability an innate emotions''
  \point disabling different parts of the aforementioned circuit, when looking at mating behaviors, can all have different effects on mating behavior (e.g., males seeking males)
  \point defensive behaviors trigger slightly different areas of the amygdala and hypothalamus, depending upon whether the stimulus is a predator or a conspecific animal.
    \subpoint NOTE: this seems to back up the idea of building on / expanding existing structures to grow the brain in Ortus
  \point VNO organ (receptors) appear(s) to have evolved specifically to respond to cues that depend upon the animal's survival in the wild (so, to react to specific species)
  \point Gene expression is correlated with ``patterns to subsets of innate behaviors''
  \point Estrogen and Testosterone both greatly impact (at least certain) the development of innate behaviors. In females, it is the primary hormone in the ``induction of maternal care''.
    \subpoint Enzyme ``aromatose'' converts testosterone to estrogen in male brains. Without this, all aggressive behavior against intruder males disappears.
        \subsubpoint Perhaps the hormonal state of an animal influences the connectivity? (note: that seems like it would require *very* plastic synapses\ldots)
  \point Hormones (sex, and others) have an impact on the formation of neural circuits as well as the modulation of innate sex--specific behaviors.
  \point By embryonic day (E) 18, most neurons dedicated for the limbic system have migrated to their final locations, and in some cases, begun to make connections.
    \subpoint Early post--natal period is primarily characterized by elaboration of both short and long range connections, and shaping of circuits via experience and sex--specific hormone levels (note: what about other hormones?)
    \point Neuronal patterning and specification of neurons is accomplished via the action sof delinated sets of transcription factors (typically homeodomain and bHLH classes)
        \subpoint These genes have been conserved through evolution and act in many specices (fly, worm, mammals) -- so, they're important in neuronal dev.
  \point Seems to be a genetically predetermined program of migration, differentiation, synaptogenesis, and maturation.
  \point As a single olfactory sensory neuron matures, it will express a single olfactory receptor type, which detects a specific chemoical cue.
    \subpoint During development, olfactory receptor genes are turned on synchronously in a spacially restricted manner, establishing zones.
  \point Axons from olfactory receptor neurons form glomeruli (glomerulus, singular) in olfactory bulbs through a hierarchical process (olfactory sensory epithelial neurons expressing the same receptor type innervate common glomeruli)
    \subpoint May be driven by olfactory receptor itself where a mechanism downstream of the actual olfactory receptors enables fasciculation of axons taht express simmilar receptors
        \subsubpoint G--coupled receptors may generate  unique level of cAMP which regulates the expression of guidance factors Nrpl and Sema3A
  \point Olfactory epithelial targeting of the olfactory bulb occurs at the same time that axonal projections from the olfactory bulb to deeper brain regions occur
    \subpoint This suggests these guidance events are independent of each other, and sensory inputs.
  \point Many neuronal cell types within the brain are generated far from the mature strucutres they will eventually populate (so, it's hard to draw connections btween embryonic development and post--natal structures---this was in reference to development of amygdala and hyothalamus)
  \point Different nuceli of the amygdala, associated with different behaviors, express distinct patterns of LIM--homeodomain containing genes during development.
    \subpoint The combinatorial expression patterns of LIM genes may provide a comprehensive mechanism for patterning the amygdala
    \subpoint A nucleus, as it relates to neuroanatomy is a cluster of neurons that have roughly similar connections and functions
  \point The same sort of gene encoding of transcription factors and regional specificity seen in the amygdala is seen in the hypothalamus.
  \point Mice that don't have certain genes won't have proper positioning of certain neurons, or necessary hypothalamic nuclei (influenced by Sim1, and Otp transcription factors, respectively)
  \point It's possible that in addition to patterning neuronal identity, key transcription factors encode subsets of genes (most likley cell adhesion molecules) that would be required for limbic circuit specific connectivity)
  \point Gene ``Met'', a receptor tyrosine kinase, detected in key limbic areas (cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, and septum, can alter arbor complexity, increase growth and excitatory synapse formation.
