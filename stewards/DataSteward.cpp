/* we want everything stored in opencl-compatible datatypes. data will go directly from here, to opencl buffers.
 
  ** At the moment, we are going to ignore the issue of physical proximity with respect to how it impacts computation (e.g., greater time delay for neuron C because it's farther from A than B is, despite both being directly connected to A), or signal decay.
    *** This is because it will add complexity to the computation, as well as the system that enables neurons to be added.
 
  * we will have extra space at the end of each row, in 2D arrays (from now on, 2D means a 1D array being used as a 2D array), meaning that under normal operation, there will effectively be 'blanks' at the end of each 'row' in the 1D array representation. 
    ** This is where we'll put the weights for the new neurons. This is how we will grow the network without slowing things down significantly. Upon writing the new connectome, we'll first re-organize.
 
 * This class will hold all of the real data. 
 ******** UNLESS WE ARE NO LONGER USING THE DATA (e.g. it's historic voltage data per neuron),
  EVERYTHING ELSE IN ORTUS WILL HOLD A --REFERENCE-- TO THE DATA HELD HERE. THAT INCLUDES WEIGHTS, POLARITY, NEUROTRANSMITTERS, NEURONS, ETC..
    --> the reason for this, is so that we can pass data to and from opencl without constantly having to re-intitalize the 1D representations of data. It keeps things simple.

/* we need another blade:
 

 
 =========> 'active state', cut down on this.
 -----------> 'sleeping state', or 'reflective state', maybe go back and do something?
 
 
 
 
 so, just as the connectome is a square matrix, and each entry is a weight,
 in this blade, each entry will be a crossCorrelation
 
 maybe -- pass in two, three, etc.. historic voltage arrays, and compute the xcorr in the kernel,
 and then alter the weight based upon that:
    -> if postiviely correlated at 0 offset (signals are on top of eachother):
        -> if positive change in correlation (so, more positive):
            -> increase strength of excititory synapse
        -> if negative change in correlation (so, less positive):
            -> decrease strength of excitatory synapse
    -> if inversely correlated at 0 offset (signals are on top of eachother)::
        -> if positive change in correlation (so, more negative):
            -> increase strength of inhibitory synapse
        -> if negative change in correlation (so, less negative):
            -> decrease strength of inhibitory synapse
    -> if postiviely correlated at offset > 0, where presynaptic neuron's signal is offset:
        -> if positive change in correlation (so, more positive):
            -> increase strength of excititory synapse
        -> if negative change in correlation (so, less positive):
            -> decrease strength of excitatory synapse
    -> if inversely correlated at offset > 0, where presynaptic neuron's signal is offset:
        -> if positive change in correlation (so, more negative):
            -> increase strength of inhibitory synapse
        -> if negative change in correlation (so, less negative):
            -> decrease strength of inhibitory synapse
 
 
    => note: 'change' refers to xcorr value from previous time-step (iteration)
 
    So, how do gap junctions factor into this? 
        -> 
            * if neuron A, at time n (A[n]) has an activation, x, and
            * if neuron B, at time n (B[n]) has an activation, y, and
            * if A[n+1] has an activation x+dX, then:
                * if B[n+1] has an activation y+dY
                => we have a correlation
                * if B[n+1] has an activation,  y, and if B[n+2] has an activation y+dY
