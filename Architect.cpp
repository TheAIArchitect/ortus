 so, just as the connectome is a square matrix, and each entry is a weight,
 in this blade, each entry will be a crossCorrelation
 
 maybe -- pass in two, three, etc.. historic voltage arrays, and compute the xcorr in the kernel,
 and then alter the weight based upon that:
 -> if postiviely correlated at 0 offset (signals are on top of eachother):
 -> if positive change in correlation (so, more positive):
 -> increase strength of excititory synapse
 -> if negative change in correlation (so, less positive):
 -> decrease strength of excitatory synapse
 -> if inversely correlated at 0 offset (signals are on top of eachother)::
 -> if positive change in correlation (so, more negative):
 -> increase strength of inhibitory synapse
 -> if negative change in correlation (so, less negative):
 -> decrease strength of inhibitory synapse
 -> if postiviely correlated at offset > 0, where presynaptic neuron's signal is offset:
 -> if positive change in correlation (so, more positive):
 -> increase strength of excititory synapse
 -> if negative change in correlation (so, less positive):
 -> decrease strength of excitatory synapse
 -> if inversely correlated at offset > 0, where presynaptic neuron's signal is offset:
 -> if positive change in correlation (so, more negative):
 -> increase strength of inhibitory synapse
 -> if negative change in correlation (so, less negative):
 -> decrease strength of inhibitory synapse
