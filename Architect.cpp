/* we need another blade:
 
 =========> 'active state', cut down on this.
 -----------> 'sleeping state', or 'reflective state', maybe go back and do something?
 
 
 
 
 so, just as the connectome is a square matrix, and each entry is a weight,
 in this blade, each entry will be a crossCorrelation
 
 maybe -- pass in two, three, etc.. historic voltage arrays, and compute the xcorr in the kernel,
 and then alter the weight based upon that:
 -> if postiviely correlated at 0 offset (signals are on top of eachother):
 -> if positive change in correlation (so, more positive):
 -> increase strength of excititory synapse
 -> if negative change in correlation (so, less positive):
 -> decrease strength of excitatory synapse
 -> if inversely correlated at 0 offset (signals are on top of eachother)::
 -> if positive change in correlation (so, more negative):
 -> increase strength of inhibitory synapse
 -> if negative change in correlation (so, less negative):
 -> decrease strength of inhibitory synapse
 -> if postiviely correlated at offset > 0, where presynaptic neuron's signal is offset:
 -> if positive change in correlation (so, more positive):
 -> increase strength of excititory synapse
 -> if negative change in correlation (so, less positive):
 -> decrease strength of excitatory synapse
 -> if inversely correlated at offset > 0, where presynaptic neuron's signal is offset:
 -> if positive change in correlation (so, more negative):
 -> increase strength of inhibitory synapse
 -> if negative change in correlation (so, less negative):
 -> decrease strength of inhibitory synapse
 
 
 => note: 'change' refers to xcorr value from previous time-step (iteration)
 
 So, how do gap junctions factor into this?
 ->
 * if neuron A, at time n (A[n]) has an activation, x, and
 * if neuron B, at time n (B[n]) has an activation, y, and
 * if A[n+1] has an activation x+dX, then:
 * if B[n+1] has an activation y+dY
 => we have a correlation
 * if B[n+1] has an activation,  y, and if B[n+2] has an activation y+dY
 => we have a causal relationship
