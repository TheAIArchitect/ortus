ortus todo

* alter writeConnectome to have it re-order to put all sensors before inters before motors (before muscles)
* fix Probe
* re-implement checks from get_conns (checks for ablated elements, etc.)
* re-implement ComputeSteward's printReport
* add new timing code to various places
    -> TBD
* implement StimuliSteward::normalizeStimuli
* subplots for DataVisualizer (see "Plotr" below)
* consider smart pointers.
* kernel could use some clean-up






/////////////////////

next:

- H2O has been added with O2 deprevation. Now, need to have ortus draw connection between IFEAR and H2O.
- figure out good way to graph xcorr
    -> this will be helpful to figure out rules for modifying gaps and chems
- apply rules to modify gaps and chems, based upon xcorr computation
- modify writeConnectome to sort new neurons
    -> also need a way to name them...
- modify connectome to include learning rates
    -> what should default learning rate be?
    -> what are rules to govern changes in learning rate?
