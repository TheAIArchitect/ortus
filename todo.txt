* alter writeConnectome to have it re-order to put all sensors before inters before motors (before muscles)
* fix Probe
* re-implement checks from get_conns (checks for ablated elements, etc.)
* re-implement ComputeSteward's printReport
* add new timing code to various places
    -> TBD
* implement StimuliSteward::normalizeStimuli
* subplots for DataVisualizer (see "Plotr" below)
* consider smart pointers.
* kernel could use some clean-up




Plotr
* subplots

next:

- make sure this is the best way, but, create global buffer for 'scratch pad' so that xcorr can be computer in opencl
- apply rules to modify gaps and chems, based upon xcorr computation
- modify writeConnectome
- add h20 stimulus and play with results.
