Ortus Development Rules Language

1) filetype is *.ort

2) Order of Rules is irrelevant in file.

3) Rule format is:

[-,+] <Pre> (<>,>) [-,+] <Post>

Where:

A) [-,+] is either "-" or "+".
"-" means that the rule being expressed is valid when the <Pre> that follows *decreases* in activation.
"+" means that the rule being expressed is valid when the <Pre> that follows *increases* in activation.
If neither "-" nor "+", the rule being expressed must be a Gap Junction (GJ).

B) <Pre> is the *case--insensitive* name of the presynaptic neuron.
In a later version of this specification, it might be acceptable to combine multiple presynaptic neurons on one line, but at the moment, each line may only have one presynaptic neuron. 

C) (<>,>) is either "<>" or ">".
"<>" means that the rule being expressed is a GJ. In this case, it is not valid for the <Pre> or <Post> terms (neurons) to have a directional specififer (either "-" or "+")
">" means that the rule being expressed is a Chemical Synapse (CS), and the direction is such that <Pre> influences <Post>. In this case, both <Pre> and <Post> *must* have a directional specifier.

D) <Post> is the *case--insensitive* name of the postsynaptic neuron.
In a later version of this specification, it might be acceptable to combine multiple presynaptic neurons on one line, but at the moment, each line may only have one presynaptic neuron. 

E) Whitespace is irrelevant

4) Comments begin with a double forward slash, "//". There are no block comments

1) The file is read line by line, with lines beginning with "//" ignored.
