Modifications to .csv files prior to converstion with WormwiringCSVToSQLite.cpp:

- Changed "PHARYNX - NEURONS" (3rd row and column, and vice versa) to "PHARYNX INTERNEURONS"
- Added "PHARYNX MOTORNEURONS" starting at M1 (breaking up the previously named "PHARYNX - NEURONS" into interneurons and motorneurons
    - Note: MI, NSML, NSMR, MCL and MCR are not really motorneurons... more like motorinter neurons
- Removed dash and a space in "PHARYNX - MUSCLES" to read "PHARYNX MUSCLES"
- Removed spaces between "MOTOR NEURONS" anywhere it appeared, to read "MOTORNEURONS"
- Changed "SEX MN's" to "SEX MOTORNEURONS"


NOTE: 9/15/16 - THESE NEED TO BE REFRESHED!!!!
