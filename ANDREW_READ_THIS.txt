For the most part all you're going to care about is what's found in the "pelegans" folder. Inside
that folder is "main.cpp", it's currently testing the the classes we currently care about so you can
follow along with the calls there. Keep in mind this is still reading in fake neuron fake and still
setting BS polarities.

mainKernel.cl is the active kernel, it's a translation of the algorithm you had written up in the
old java version.

Core.{h,c}pp is the heart of what's going on. Due to the use of opencl things have to happen in a
specific order, so if you make a change somewhere to opencl related stuff make sure all is good.
It makes use of MatrixSetup for all the matrix related stuff, MatrixSetup is also where the data
is populated from (fake init voltages and polarities).

TSQueue is verified thread safe, though the queue operations aren't currently being handled in a MT
way so it doesn't actually matter.

There are still some classes in the main pelegans directory that were for the old system not using
matricies so you can just ignore them. I'm pretty sure they are just:
    - NeuronContainer
    - GPUNeuron

CoreProcessor and VoltageDataWriter aren't implemented yet but the idea is to use them in a
background thread to write the data to the db (or file) and to process the data (the genetic algo).

The genetic algorithm I had mostly implemented for the body is more or less useless for the neuron
evolution so I'll start implementing the new algorithm when I'm back from the beach tuesday

ALSO NOTE:::: My library files need to be updated here, they're quite old. I don't feel like doing
that right now because there are a few functions with changes that break what they're currently
doing. When I have down-time over the next few days I'll push the updated files and make sure all
is working as expected.
