- Modify "get_polarity_vector" (line 96 in Core) to make motors and sensories excitatory,
and inters inhibitory with 80% probability.
    = don't actually modify, we want another function, so we can compare the two

- Create framework to add stimulation and feedback

- Rework code so that after each iteration, stuff gets re-loaded


=======================================

9/16/16

-> find way to save connections read in from CSV files. It takes an annoyingly long time to parse those each time.
-> print out conns vector from ElementInfoModules, cross check with full connectome list from wormwiring
-> separate making the eim (ElementInfoModules) from parsing the gaps
    => YES! there's another note about this in DataSteward's initialization function (init)
-> need to clean up all the different indices for the mim/nim/eim stuff
-> clean up makeMuscleModules in DataSteward... it's a disaster.'
-> fix fileshit typetoenum on 156 -- it's still using poly and other stuff for colors. we need to change that so that it uses the types used by wormwiring, and not the type info from openworm.
-> fix name to id mapping -- it was using database data, but now we're not using that...'
-> VERY IMPORTANT - this needs to be redone using the ElementInfoModules: the neuron to muscle mapping function in DataStewart
-> use new CSVs, make edits noted in the csv notes in the csv dir, and make sure to deal with the "MN's" 'section' in the CSV -- also, re-add check in makeMuscleModules in DataSteward
-> VERY SOON: allow muscles in the graphical connections -- and use the muscles we have, just blow that shit up and make them change colors

Immediate:
- scale and translate muscles (just graphics)
- make sure activation is in the mim (eim?)
- make sure / create intelligent mapping between motor neurons and muscles...
-> should probably have conns (maybe yellow?) from MNs to muscles.

-> another good thing to do would be to add connection weights and ideally directions (maybe via a text arrow, if possible) in the middle of line segments.

-> MAKE SURE THAT THE MODULE CREATION IN 34X in GraphicsGovernor is supposed to happen!! i don't think it is...
