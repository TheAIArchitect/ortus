thoughts (10/4/16):

- issue: can see signal propagate though; many neurons end up going as negative as possible
- however, SIM(B/V)L will go high, that's encouraging.

- perhaps we need more signals (mechanical, temperature, etc.), and c. elegans' sensory system is an inhibitory system, where out of the ordinary movements are a result of certain signals not being allowed to propagate rather than signals being encouraged to propagate (see abstract: http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2013.00128/full )

- one way to look into this would be to attach the fake muscles, and hook the motor neurons up to it ... then we can give a number of different sensory inputs, and see what happens to the colors of the muscles. this might be the best bet.

- also, look at current papers already collected, and any new work on polarities and general c. elegans functionality (google scholar).
