/*
 * Implements some of the algorithms in StrUtils, FileUtils, NumUtils, GeneralUtils in parallel.
 *
 * The pool is static, and all function calls will use the same pool. The pool will be started at 
 * the first call to startPool, subsequent calls will do nothing.
 * 
 * Calls to setNumberOfThreadsInPool will unfortunately (as of now) kill the current pool and start
 * a new pool once tasks in the current pool have finished. 
 * 
 * Calls to serSerialCrossoverPoint will only impact tasks that have not yet been submitted, any 
 * task that is currently running will use the old value.
 *
 * Defaults:
 *  - NUM_THREADS, defaults to std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
 *  - JUMP_TO_SERIAL, defaults to 15 tasks per thread
 *      - e.g., trimStrVec where NUM_THREADS = 4 and the vector has 50 strings to be trimmed:
 *          The parallel call will not split the vector up between the threads, instead it will 
 *          call the serial version of that function
 *      - e.g., trimStrVec where NUM_THREADS = 4 and the vector has 100 strings, it will
 *          split the vector into NUM_THREADS component vectors and concurrently pass them through
 *          the serial version of trimStrVec, after the threads have returned the vectors will be
 *          reassembled into a single vector and returned. 
 *      - My testing on my machine tells me that 15 items per thread is the right number, below that
 *        it does not make sense to split and reassemble the data. Your results may vary. 
 *  
 *  NOTE:   Calculating number of items per thread obviously incurs some overhead, if you are fairly
 *          certain that your data does not need to be parallelized this overhead can add up. Each
 *          call to the parallel version of a function incurs about 80 microseconds of overhead
 *          compared with the serial version
 *          
 *          The remaining overhead (hence the 15 tasks per thread) comes from splitting the data
 *          add then putting it back together after the threads complete. 
 *
 *          My testing has shown the parallel functions to produce the same output as their serial
 *          versions (testing in ParallelTest.cpp), however more stringent testing is required to be
 *          considered 'production ready' (though that's how I'm using it...). This class will not 
 *          be merged into the stable (master) branch until said testing is complete.
 *
 *  startPool() is called at the beginning of all algorithms and runTask with the currently defined
 *  values for NUM_THREADS and JUMP_TO_SERIAL. If a pool is running nothing will happen, if a pool 
 *  has not already been started a new one will be started.
